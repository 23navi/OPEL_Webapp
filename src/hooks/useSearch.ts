/*

ðŸ”’ Why React Query requires a return value
    React Query is a data-fetching and caching library. It:

    Runs your queryFn (the one you give it).

    Stores the result in its internal cache based on the query key.

    Provides you that data via data, isFetching, etc.

    If your queryFn doesnâ€™t return anything, React Query canâ€™t cache anything, which breaks its core feature set.
    That's why React Query throws this error â€” to prevent you from silently misusing it.
